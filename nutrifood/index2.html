                        Health Organisation(WHO), those with pre-existing non-communicable diseases also appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.</p>

                    <h2>Consider Supplements</h2>
                    <p>You may find it hard to get some nutrients in your diet, especially if you have to avoid some foods. Ask your doctor if you should take a vitamin or mineral supplement, such as calcium, vitamin D, magnesium, or vitamin B-12. These
                        specific vitamins are often poorly absorbed or not consumed enough by older Americans. Some supplements can interfere with certain medications. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about potential side effects before starting a new supplement
                        or medication</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2>Stay Hydrated and Stay Social</h2>
                    <p>As you age, you may not notice when you’re thirsty. Make sure you’re drinking fluids on a regular basis. Aim for eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily. You can also get some water from juice, tea, soup, or even water-rich fruits and
                        vegetables.<br> When you can, eat with friends and family members. Social interaction can turn mealtimes into an enjoyable affair, rather than a chore you’d rather skip</p>

                    <h2>Healthy diet to infants.</h2>
                    <p>Infant nutrition means making sure your baby is getting enough nutrients during his first year. Nutrients are calories, protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals. Making sure your baby has good nutrition can protect him against disease.
                        It also helps him stay healthy as he grows older.<br> Breast milk contains antibodies that help your baby fight off viruses and bacteria. Breastfeeding lowers your baby's risk of having asthma or allergies. Plus, babies who are
                        breastfed exclusively for the first 6 months.</p>
